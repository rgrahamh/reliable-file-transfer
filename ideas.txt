UDP already has checksums.
We need to add in a way to check for order of delivery and that the packets actually were delivered.
Order of deliver add sequence numbers in metadata.
Ack and negAck for delivery reliablility.
Implement a three way handshake to ensure connection before sending any information.
Timeout is 2 seconds and retry 8 times.


sequence number is one bit. 0 or a 1. Dont send anything new until 0 or 1 ack received. 

32 byte payloads with additional bytes for headers etc.

handshake bit set to 1 whenever we want to do the handshake. set to 0 the rest of the time

so the 2 most significant bits of the payload will be the handshake bit and the sequence number
